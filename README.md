#Cocos2dx UIKit

This is an example of how to integrate iOS UIKit with Cocos2d-x

Added [SWRevealViewController](https://github.com/John-Lluch/SWRevealViewController) as main navigation controller.   
This project is built with Xcode 6.4 and Cocos2d-x v3.8 (with some minor modifications).  
  
**Note:** Only demostrates UIKit integration, has no support for device orientation (but it can be easily supported).
